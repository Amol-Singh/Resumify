## 🧠 Introduction

**Resumify** is an AI-powered resume feedback web application that helps job seekers improve their resumes through automated analysis and real-time visual insights.

Users can upload a resume and receive AI-generated feedback on content quality, skills, formatting, keywords, and ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility. This web app bridges the gap between generic resume templates and industry-optimized documents by providing targeted suggestions and enhancement tips through an interactive review interface.


## 🧰 Tech Stack

This project leverages modern web technologies and powerful AI integrations:

- **React (with Remix)**: Used for building a fast, scalable frontend UI with server-side rendering capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid styling with utility-first classes and responsive design out of the box.
- **Puter SDK (File System + Key-Value Store)**: Utilized to store uploaded resumes, feedback, and related data persistently and securely.
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Used Anthropic’s language model to generate structured, categorized resume feedback for quick retrieval and display.
- **Custom Image-to-PDF Preview**: Users get a live preview of their uploaded resumes, converted and rendered using blob-based previews.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across all major data structures, particularly for feedback and resume metadata.
